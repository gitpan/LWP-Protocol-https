Initial release of LWP-Protocol-https as a separate distribution. There are no code
changes besides setting the version number since libwww-perl-6.01.

The LWP::Protocol::https module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl
distribution, but it was unbundled in v6.02 in order to be able to declare its
dependencies properly for the CPAN tool chain.  Applications that need https
support can just declare their dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no
longer need to know what underlying modules to install.
